        <strong>About Me</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Hi, my name is <strong>Rajkumar Shashwata Halder</strong>. I am a <strong>Web Developer</strong> with one
        year's worth of professional experience designing, developing and
        maintaining web applications and have a Bachelors in Computer Science from
        Notre Dame University, Bangladesh. I am very passionate about learning and
        exploring new technologies in hopes of sharpening my skills and expanding
        my knowledge in the world of Web Applications. I have experience in a
        multitude of different technologies such as <strong>Python, Django, HTML, CSS,
            Javascript, ReactJS, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform,
            PostgreSQL, Linux</strong> and more. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg
        of things that I want to learn and eventually master. I hope to continue
        working in this field as I find creating Applications not only
        challenging, but extremely rewarding.
        <br />
        <br />

        I pride myself in the quality of my work, my eagerness to learn and my
        ability to take the initiative. I am a strong believer that with enough
        time and effort, one can achieve anything. This is the mindset that helps
        me continue moving forward in this ever advancing field of technology. My
        dream is to become the best at what I love doing and make a living from
        it.
